# Hypothesize that the proportion of late shipments is 6%
p_0 = 0.06

# Calculate the sample proportion of late shipments
p_hat = (late_shipments['late'] == "Yes").mean()

# Calculate the sample size
n = len(late_shipments)

# Calculate the numerator and denominator of the test statistic
numerator = p_hat - p_0
denominator = np.sqrt(p_0 * (1 - p_0) / n)

# Calculate the test statistic
z_score = numerator / denominator

# Calculate the p-value from the z-score
p_value = 1 - norm.cdf(z_score)

# Print the p-value
print(p_value)
